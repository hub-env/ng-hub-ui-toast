# ng-hub-ui-toast Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The repository moved to the `hub-env` organization. Issues for every Hub UI package are now
  gathered in [hub-env/hub-ui](https://github.com/hub-env/hub-ui/issues), and the `repository`, `bugs`
  and README links point at the new addresses. GitHub redirects the old ones.

## [22.11.0] - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- **BREAKING — the four exported classes are renamed with the `Hub` prefix.** `ToastService` is
  now `HubToastService`, `ToastConfigService` is `HubToastConfigService`, `ToastComponent` is
  `HubToastComponent` and `ToastContainerComponent` is `HubToastContainerComponent`. `ToastService`
  is the name an application is most likely to give its own notification wrapper, so a library
  holding it holds something that was never the library's to hold: the file that imports both ends
  up aliasing its way out of a collision it did not create. The types of this same package —
  `HubToastConfig`, `HubToastRef`, `HubToastPosition` — already carried the prefix, so the surface
  was being spelled two ways in one import list. All four old names stay exported as deprecated
  aliases resolving to the same classes, so injection and providers keep working unchanged, and
  they are removed in 23.0.0. See `BREAKING_CHANGES.md`.

- **`ng-hub-ui-ds` is declared as an optional peer dependency, `>=22.0.0`.** The stylesheet themes
  against `--hub-sys-*`, and the manifest never said so: nothing warned that a `ng-hub-ui-ds` older
  than the `--hub-ref-*` / `--hub-sys-*` architecture would leave the toast on its fallbacks, and a
  reader of the manifest had no way to learn that the token package is what turns the theme on.
  `peerDependenciesMeta` marks it optional, so an installation without it stays clean.

### Fixed

- **A toast now keeps its colour when `ng-hub-ui-ds` is not installed.** The nine accent
  declarations — one per built-in type, plus the `danger` mapping that `error` uses — read
  `--hub-sys-color-<type>` with no fallback, and they were the only `--hub-sys-*` reads in the
  sheet without one. Without the token package the read has nothing to resolve to, which makes the
  whole `--hub-toast-accent` declaration invalid at computed-value time rather than falling back to
  the neutral accent declared above it; `--hub-toast-bg`, `--hub-toast-color` and
  `--hub-toast-border` are all mixed from that slot, so `background`, `color` and `border-color`
  went unset together and a success toast arrived transparent and unbordered. Each type now names
  the Bootstrap-equivalent colour the rest of this family already uses as its fallback, so a toast
  with no design system installed degrades to a recognisable colour instead of to no colour at all.

## [22.10.0] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **A notification dropped at `maxOpened` no longer hands back a handle that never says
  anything.** With the stack full and `autoDismiss` off, the call was refused and the handle
  returned was built over an empty object: its three lifecycle observables were `undefined`, so
  each fell back to a brand-new `Subject` that nothing on earth would ever complete or emit.
  Awaiting the close of that notification — `await firstValueFrom(ref.onHidden)`, the ordinary
  way of waiting for a toast to go away — waited for the rest of the session, and nothing on the
  handle said the notification had not even been shown. The handle now closes at once:
  `onHidden` emits and completes, `onShown` and `onTap` complete without emitting, and
  `manualClose()` / `resetTimeout()` are no-ops.
- **A new notification no longer relocates the ones already on screen.** There was a single
  container, and it took its position class from whichever toast happened to be first in the
  list, so a call with a different `positionClass` dragged every visible toast to the new corner
  — the ones the user was in the middle of reading included. Each position now has its own
  container, mounted the first time a toast asks for it, and a toast is only ever rendered by
  the container of its own corner. This is the arrangement `ngx-toastr` and `react-toastify`
  have used for years: one overlay per position, created on demand.

- **A toast that has just opened is painted above the ones already there.** With `newestOnTop`
  the newest toast is rendered first in the DOM, and a first sibling paints underneath the ones
  that follow it, so an arriving toast slid in beneath its neighbours' shadows. Stacking now
  follows recency rather than DOM order.

### Added

- **`HubToastRef.dropped`** — `true` when the call was refused and no toast reached the screen,
  `false` on every handle that stands for a real notification. `toastId` stays `-1` for a
  dropped handle, but that was never documented and reads as an implementation detail; `dropped`
  is the question a caller actually wants to ask.
- **`ToastContainerComponent` takes a `position` input**, the position class it owns and the only
  one whose toasts it renders. `ToastService` sets it on mount; it defaults to `toast-top-right`.

- **The documentation says what `maxOpened` counts.** The cap is on the whole stack, not on one
  corner of it, and `autoDismiss` therefore drops the oldest toast on screen even when that toast
  is in a different position. Behaviour is unchanged — it was simply impossible for a consumer to
  know which of the two it was.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (types) — `HubToastRef` gained a required `dropped: boolean`.** Only code that
  builds a `HubToastRef` by hand is affected — a test double or a fake service. Everything that
  takes the handle from `ToastService` keeps compiling. See `BREAKING_CHANGES.md`.
- **BREAKING (markup) — the overlay is one container per position, not one container.** Where
  `document.body` used to hold a single `hub-toast-container` whose class changed as toasts came
  and went, it now holds one element per position class actually used, each keeping its own
  corner for good. CSS or tests written around there being exactly one container, or around its
  class changing, need updating. See `BREAKING_CHANGES.md`.

## [22.8.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- **The close button's accessible name is now a config option, `closeButtonAriaLabel`.** The `×`
  glyph is decorative, so that name was the only thing a screen reader had to announce the toast's
  single control — and it was the English literal `Close`, frozen in the template, unreachable from
  `provideToast()` or a per-call config. A library shipped to applications that are not in English
  cannot hardcode a user-facing string.

- **`FUNCTIONALITIES.md`.** Nine sibling libraries carry one and the repository's own checklist
  asks for it on every change; toast had none, so nothing recorded which parts of the API a
  reader of the docs can actually operate and which are only prose.

### Changed

- **`HubToastConfig` now carries a required `closeButtonAriaLabel`.** Only code that builds a full
  `HubToastConfig` literal by hand is affected — everything that goes through `provideToast()` or a
  per-call override keeps compiling. See `BREAKING_CHANGES.md`.

- **`HubToastData` now carries a required `restartToken` signal.** The data object keeps its
  identity for the whole life of a toast, so nothing in it could tell the rendered component to
  start its countdown over; this signal is that channel. Only code that builds a `HubToastData`
  literal by hand is affected — see `BREAKING_CHANGES.md`.

### Fixed

- **A closing toast now completes its three lifecycle observables, not just `onHidden`.** `onShown`
  and `onTap` were left open on a toast that no longer existed, so a consumer who subscribed without
  a `takeUntil` kept the subscription — and the toast data behind it — alive for the rest of the
  session, with no completion to hang a teardown on. Both `remove()` and `clear()` now close the
  whole lifecycle.

- **The documentation no longer describes a library that does not exist.** `README.md` and
  `README.es.md` sold the package as having zero external dependencies and listed only the two
  Angular peers, so anyone installing by hand — rather than through `ng add ng-hub-ui` — got a
  module-not-found on `resolveHubAccent` the first time a toast fired. They also gave
  `--hub-toast-title-font-weight` as a bare `600` when the code routes it through
  `--hub-ref-font-weight-semibold`, typed `positionClass` as `HubToastPosition` when it accepts
  any string, named four semantic types where the stylesheet maps nine, omitted the three derived
  accent roles, and documented two of the eight public exports. `BREAKING_CHANGES.md` was missing
  the 22.3.0 `--hub-toast-container-z-index` → `--hub-toast-container-zindex` rename, which is the
  one kind of change this file exists to announce — a renamed custom property fails silently.
- **`HubToastRef.resetTimeout()` restarts the auto-dismiss countdown, as its documentation always
  promised.** It used to re-emit `onShown$` and touch no timer state at all, so a caller who wanted
  to keep a toast on screen a while longer had no way to do it — the toast still vanished on its
  original schedule, and the spurious emission also broke the "fires once" contract of `onShown`.
  A toast configured with `disableTimeOut` stays persistent, as before.

## [22.7.2] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- **The `homepage` in the manifest points at this library's own documentation page** rather than at
  the site root. It is the link a registry shows beside the package and the one a reader clicks from
  it, and landing on a front page they then have to search is a worse answer than landing on the
  reference for the package they were already looking at. Metadata only — no code, no types, no
  styles change, and nothing a consumer imports is affected.

## [22.7.1] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- **The published package declared no licence.** An absent `license` field is not neutral — a registry reports it as unlicensed, which legally reads as all rights reserved, the most restrictive state possible rather than the most open. The intent was always MIT; it is now stated in `package.json` and carried in a `LICENSE` file that ships with the package.

## [22.7.0] - 2026-08-14

### Changed

- Replaced the deprecated Angular animation trigger with a native CSS enter animation that respects reduced-motion preferences.

### Removed

- **Removed the `@angular/animations` peer dependency.** The package is deprecated upstream and the library no longer needs it. Applications that installed it only for `ng-hub-ui-toast` can drop it; those using it elsewhere are unaffected.

## [22.6.1] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- Documentation links now point at the canonical localized URLs. The README linked to `https://hubui.dev/<path>` with no locale prefix and no trailing slash, and both forms are 301-redirected, so every reader arriving from npm or GitHub landed on a redirect instead of the canonical page.

## [22.6.0] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- **Accent resolution now imports the canonical `resolveHubAccent` from `ng-hub-ui-utils`.** The private copy under `src/lib/shared/resolve-hub-accent.ts` (used to resolve custom toast `type` accents) has been deleted in favour of the single, tested implementation shared family-wide. Behaviour is identical (the copy had not diverged): a bareword resolves to `var(--hub-sys-color-<name>, <name>)`, a literal colour passes through unchanged, an empty value yields `null`.

### Added

- **NEW peer dependency: `ng-hub-ui-utils` `>=22.7.0`.** Consumers must have `ng-hub-ui-utils` installed alongside this library (it is where `resolveHubAccent` lives). Users installing via `ng add ng-hub-ui` get it automatically; manual installs need `npm i ng-hub-ui-utils`.

## [22.5.2] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- **Toasts are announced to screen readers.** Each toast host is now a live region: `role="alert"` + `aria-live="assertive"` for `error`/`warning`, `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"` for everything else, with `aria-atomic="true"`. Previously no live region existed anywhere, so notifications were invisible to assistive technology. Keyboard dismissal was already available through the close button (`config.closeButton`); the host tap remains a pointer convenience.

## [22.5.1] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- **`NG0205: Injector has already been destroyed` when a toast is raised just before teardown.** The toast container is mounted from the `.then()` of a dynamic `import()`, which resolves on a later microtask; if the application was destroyed in the meantime (a route teardown, an HMR reload, a finished test), `createComponent()` reached into a dead environment injector and threw. The mount now bails out when `ApplicationRef.destroyed` is set.

## [22.5.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Toast `type` accepts ANY colour.** A custom `type` (anything beyond the built-ins `success` / `error` / `warning` / `info`) now accepts a **registered accent name** _or_ a **literal colour** (`#ff0000`, `rgb(...)`, `oklch(...)`, a CSS named colour). A bareword resolves to its `--hub-sys-color-*` token with the word as raw fallback; a literal is used as-is. The full accent family (`-subtle` / `-emphasis` / `-on`) still re-derives from it via `color-mix`. Built-in types (and the `error`→`danger` mapping) are unchanged.
- **`ng-hub-ui-toast/styles` root entry.** A `styles/index.scss` now forwards `hub-toast-theme`, so `@use 'ng-hub-ui-toast/styles' as *;` exposes the mixin from the package root.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (packaging) — SCSS ships at `ng-hub-ui-toast/styles`.** The theming mixin now builds to `dist/toast/styles/...` (was `dist/toast/src/lib/styles/...`), so `@use 'ng-hub-ui-toast/styles'` (and `.../styles/mixins/toast-theme`) resolves. Update any `@use` that reached into `src/lib/styles`.

## [22.4.0] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- **One derivation strategy — canonical accent slot.** The built-in `data-type`s (`success` / `warning` / `info` / `primary` / `secondary` / `neutral` / `light` / `dark`, plus `error`→danger) now re-base ONLY the single `--hub-toast-accent` slot; the derived role family (`-subtle` / `-emphasis` / `-on`) always recomputes locally from it, so **custom accents now re-derive the full role family at runtime** (previously the built-in types pinned the pre-computed `--hub-sys-color-<type>-*` tints, freezing the family against a runtime accent override).
- The local derivations were unified to the canonical design-system formulas — `--hub-toast-accent-subtle: color-mix(in oklch, accent 12%, --hub-sys-surface-page)` (was a `14%` mix) and `--hub-toast-accent-emphasis: color-mix(in oklch, accent 80%, --hub-sys-color-ink)` (was `72%` over `--hub-sys-text-primary`) — in the component and in the `hub-toast-theme()` mixin. These produce the same tints the ds families ship, so the built-in types render as before; custom-type tints shift very slightly to match them.

### Fixed

- `--hub-toast-shadow` inline fallback aligned with the actual ds value of `--hub-sys-shadow-md`: `0 0.5rem 1rem rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)` (was `0 0.25rem 0.75rem rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`). No change when the ds tokens are loaded.

### Docs

- Added `docs/css-variables-reference.md` — the complete CSS custom-property reference (now covered by the repo `tokens-parity` check F).
- Realigned the README CSS-variable tables with the code: `--hub-toast-shadow` fallback, `--hub-toast-progress-bg` (`srgb` → `oklch`) and `--hub-toast-container-zindex` (`var(--hub-sys-zindex-toast, 1090)`).

## [22.3.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- **Open-set accent types.** The built-in `data-type` map now also covers the full open accent set — `primary`, `secondary`, `neutral`, `light`, `dark` join the classic `success` / `warning` / `info` (and `error`→danger), each pulling its exact `--hub-sys-color-<type>` family. Any other `data-type` keeps working at runtime with no recompile: define a single `--hub-sys-color-<name>` and `data-type="<name>"` derives its surface/border/progress from the open-set `[data-type]` default.
- New derived accent roles `--hub-toast-accent-subtle`, `--hub-toast-accent-emphasis` and `--hub-toast-accent-on`, mixed locally from the single `--hub-toast-accent` slot. The toast background and text now resolve through `-subtle` / `-emphasis`; `-on` is available for accent-filled affordances.
- The `hub-toast-theme()` mixin now re-derives the accent role family whenever its `$accent` parameter is passed, so a brand accent applied on a custom selector recomputes `-subtle` / `-emphasis` / `-on` (the slot stays the single source of truth — no duplication).

### Changed

- Canonical `zindex` token name (BREAKING): `--hub-toast-container-z-index` → `--hub-toast-container-zindex` (no hyphen, matching the `--hub-sys-zindex-*` convention).
- The accent role family and the progress-bar tint are now mixed in the **OKLCH** colour space (`color-mix(in oklch, …)`) instead of sRGB, for perceptually even tints across every accent. No token API change; tints shift very slightly.

## [22.2.1] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- Design-token consistency pass: aligned inline fallback defaults with the canonical `ng-hub-ui-ds` values and routed hardcoded literals (z-index, font-weight, line-height, radii and theme-aware colours) through their `--hub-sys-*` / `--hub-ref-*` tokens, so they follow the active theme. No visual change when the ds tokens are loaded.
- Toasts now stack at the correct elevation: the container `z-index` resolves through `--hub-sys-zindex-toast` (1090) instead of a hardcoded `1050` (the modal-backdrop layer), so a toast can no longer be occluded by a modal backdrop.

## [22.2.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- New **`hub-toast-theme()` Sass mixin** (`styles/mixins/toast-theme`) — re-skin a toast in one call: accent (1px semantic border + progress colour), surfaces, border/radius/shadow, spacing, typography, progress bar, close button and container (stack) tokens. Every parameter is optional and defaults to `null`, so only the ones you pass are emitted as `--hub-toast-*` overrides; the rest keep their defaults. Apply it to `hub-toast` for all toasts, or to `hub-toast[data-type='<custom>']` to brand a custom semantic type. Token-based, no Bootstrap dependency. (The built-in `success` / `error` / `warning` / `info` tints are unchanged and still applied automatically.)
- `ng-package.json` now ships the `styles/` directory as a package asset (`assets` + `styleIncludePaths`) so the new mixin is importable from consumers via `@use 'ng-hub-ui-toast/styles/mixins/toast-theme'`.

### Changed

- **Toast accent is now a full 1px border in the semantic colour** instead of a thick left stripe. The toast keeps its tinted background and emphasis text, but the `border-inline-start` accent stripe was replaced by a plain `1px solid` border in the type's accent colour (`--hub-toast-border` now resolves to `--hub-toast-accent` for every `data-type`). The built-in types (`success` / `error` / `warning` / `info`) no longer use the muted `--hub-sys-color-*-border-subtle` token for their border; they now take the full-strength `--hub-sys-color-*` accent, so their borders are noticeably more saturated. Purely visual.

### Removed

- Removed the `--hub-toast-accent-width` token (the left accent stripe it sized no longer exists). The accent colour now drives the border and the progress bar through `--hub-toast-accent`.

## [22.1.0] - 2026-06-19

### Changed

- Lowered the Angular peer dependency floor from `>=22.0.0` to `>=21.0.0` (`@angular/core`, `@angular/common`, `@angular/animations`). The library uses only APIs available since Angular 21 (signal `input`/`output`, `effect`, `createComponent`, classic `@angular/animations` triggers), so it now installs and runs in Angular 21 applications. No source or API changes.

## [22.0.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- Initial release: `ToastService` with `success()`, `error()`, `warning()`, `info()`, `show()`, `remove()`, `clear()`
- `HubToastRef` with `onShown`, `onHidden`, `onTap` observables and `manualClose()` / `resetTimeout()`
- `ToastComponent` with signal-based auto-dismiss timer, progress bar, and close button
- `ToastContainerComponent` with six position classes
- Accent system: `@each` loop for built-in types; `color-mix` open default for custom types
- `provideToast()` standalone provider function
- Angular animations: slide-in from edge, fade-out on dismiss

### Fixed

- `ToastContainerComponent` and `ToastComponent` SCSS rewritten to use `:host` selectors instead of class selectors (`.hub-toast`, `.hub-toast-container`). Class selectors compile to `[_ngcontent]` attribute selectors under Angular `ViewEncapsulation.Emulated`, which do not match when components are dynamically mounted via `createComponent` + `attachView` (host element has `[_nghost]` but not `[_ngcontent]`). Using `:host` compiles to `[_nghost]` and matches correctly in all rendering contexts.
- Change detection for the dynamically-mounted container: views created with `createComponent` + `attachView` are not reachable by Angular's signal-based "mark ancestors dirty" traversal (no parent view to traverse to). Fixed by storing the `ComponentRef` and calling `changeDetectorRef.detectChanges()` explicitly after each signal mutation.
- Error toast transparent background: the `error` type now correctly resolves to the `--hub-sys-color-danger-*` Design System token family. The DS uses `danger` (not `error`) for this semantic, so the `@each` SCSS loop was updated to handle the mapping explicitly.
